# Standardized numeric inputs and distributions

[← Back to main README](../readme.md)

## Purpose

Numeric model inputs use one common **inline** row-level convention. A row contains either a fixed value or all statistics needed to define its distribution directly. There is no separate distribution catalog and no named distribution reference.

The convention is used by statistical parcel load rates, PLET/RUSLE numeric parameters, curve number and infiltration fraction, pollutant concentrations, BMP efficiencies, and BMP costs.

## Canonical distribution columns

Use these columns where applicable:

    value, mean, sd, min, p05, p50, p95, max

Other percentile levels such as `p10`, `p25`, `p75`, and `p90` are also supported. Metadata columns such as `units`, `unit`, `notes`, and `sample_group`, plus identifiers such as `pid`, `pollutant`, `parameter`, `pathway`, or `cps`, depend on the input table.

Recognized aliases remain accepted: `average`/`avg` → `mean`, `std` → `sd`, `minimum` → `min`, `maximum` → `max`, `p0` → `min`, and `p100` → `max`.

## Accepted numeric forms

Each numeric row must use exactly one coherent specification.

| Form | Required statistics | Sampling behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed | `value` | Always returns the supplied value |
| Normal | `mean`, `sd` | Normal sampling, truncated when semantic or physical bounds apply |
| Bounded normal | `mean`, `sd`, `min`, `max` | Truncated normal within the stated bounds |
| Legacy bounded normal | `min`, `mean`, `max` | Truncated normal with inferred `sd = (max - min) / 4` |
| Uniform | `min`, `max` | Uniform between the endpoints |
| Percentile distribution | `min`, one or more `pXX`, `max` | Piecewise-linear inverse-CDF sampling |

Examples:

    Fixed:                 value=8.5
    Normal:                mean=8.5, sd=1.2
    Bounded normal:        mean=8.5, sd=1.2, min=5, max=12
    Legacy bounded normal: mean=8.5, min=5, max=12
    Uniform:               min=5, max=12
    Percentile:            min=5, p10=6, p50=8.5, p90=11, max=12

The loader rejects ambiguous rows: do not mix `value` with distribution statistics; provide both `min` and `max`; do not combine percentile statistics with `mean` or `sd`; and give percentile distributions both endpoints. It also checks finite values, nonnegative `sd`, ordered bounds, and monotonic percentiles.

## Parcel defaults and overrides

For parcel-keyed input tables that allow defaults, `pid IS NULL` defines the default row. An integer `pid` row overrides that default for the matching parcel. Both the default and the override may be fixed values or direct inline distributions.

For example, this defines a watershed-wide precipitation distribution and a different distribution for parcel 127:

    pid    mean    sd    min    max    units
    NULL   42      3     34     50     in/year
    127    46      2     40     52     in/year

Without an explicit `sample_group`, the default distribution is sampled independently for each parcel. Use `sample_group` only when multiple rows are intentionally meant to share the same sampled value within a scenario.
