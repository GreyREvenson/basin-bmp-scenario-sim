# Input and output reference

[← Back to main README](../readme.md)

## Physical input files

A typical run uses:

```text
inputs/
  config/model.yaml
  domain/domain.gpkg
  hucs/hucs.gpkg                # optional, selected by huc_parameters
  parcels/parcels.gpkg
  outlets/outlets.gpkg
  bmps/bmp_efficiency.csv
  bmps/bmp_cost.csv              # optional
```

Model variables may be stored at parcel, HUC, or domain scale. GeoPackage files may be renamed or moved by updating their YAML paths; the directory name does not control behavior. Internal table names are the model schema.

## `parcels.gpkg`

### Structural tables

`parcels` is the required spatial layer. It contains only parcel identity and geometry:

- `pid` — unique integer parcel identifier and the GeoPackage feature/primary key (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`). There is no separate `fid` parcel identifier.
- geometry — polygon/multipolygon geometry.

All parcel references in other GeoPackage tables (`pid`, `pid_up`) are integers. Non-spatial attribute tables use a technical integer `id` primary key where QGIS needs a stable editable row identifier; the model ignores that `id`.

Parcel area and perimeter are derived from geometry after clipping to the domain.

`parcel_up` is an optional attribute table with one upstream edge per row:

```text
pid | pid_up
3   | 1
3   | 2
```

`parcel_outlets` is required and contains one parcel-to-outlet relationship per row:

```text
pid | oid
1   | O1
1   | O2
```

The structural tables do not contain modeled input variables.

A parcel GeoPackage may also contain the metadata table:

```text
model_input_schema
schema_version
3
```

Schema version `3` identifies the integer-PID/NULL-default one-variable-per-table layout with inline-only distributions (no named distribution IDs). Unknown
`input_*` tables are rejected so misspelled variable names cannot be silently
ignored.

### Editing in QGIS

Schema-v3 GeoPackages are designed to be editable directly in QGIS. The spatial `parcels` layer uses `pid` itself as its integer feature/primary key. Attribute-only tables have a separate technical `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` so QGIS can identify and edit individual rows; this `id` is not a parcel identifier and is ignored by the model.

For a default row, leave `pid` empty/NULL in QGIS. Do not enter `*`. For delivery-ratio defaults, leave both `pid` and `oid` NULL. Parcel-specific rows must use an existing integer `pid`. Because relationship and input tables reference `parcels.pid`, changing an existing parcel PID should be treated as a schema/data migration rather than an ordinary attribute edit.

## One variable per `input_*` table

Every parcel-side user input variable has its own GeoPackage attribute table. Numeric tables use the same standardized value/distribution columns:

```text
value, mean, sd, min,
p05, p10, p25, p50, p75, p90, p95, max,
sample_group, units, notes
```


Most parcel-specific variable tables are keyed by integer `pid`. Where a table supports a package-wide default, leave `pid` as SQL `NULL`; an exact integer `pid` row overrides that default. The legacy string `"*"` is invalid in PID fields.

### Parcel selection

`input_selection_weight`

```text
pid | value | units | notes
```

Weights are deterministic, finite, and nonnegative. If the table is absent, parcel selection is uniform. A row with `pid IS NULL` may supply a default.

### HUC and domain parameter GeoPackages

Both load-generation modes support the following hierarchy, independently for each variable and natural key:

**parcel-specific row > assigned-HUC row > domain row > NULL-pid parcel default**

Select one HUC package with `huc_parameters: ../hucs/hucs.gpkg`. The spatial layer is named `hucs`:

```text
huc_id   | huc_level | geometry
05090202 | 8         | Polygon/MultiPolygon
```

`huc_id` is text to preserve leading zeroes. Supported lengths are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 digits. `huc_level` is optional; if present it must match the code length. A package must use one level, unique IDs, valid non-overlapping polygons, and a declared CRS. The loader rejects mixed/nested levels rather than choosing a precedence between them.

The `domain:` GeoPackage retains its domain boundary and may also contain `input_*` attribute tables. It represents **one run-wide domain**, not multiple independently assigned domains. Prefer the spatial layer name `domain`; its features may describe a multipart boundary.

Reuse the same variable table names and value/distribution columns at every scope. Replace the parcel key with `huc_id` at HUC scope; omit it at domain scope:

| Variable tables | Parcel keys | HUC keys | Domain keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| PLET/RUSLE parameter tables, selection weight | `pid` | `huc_id` | none |
| `input_pollutant_load_rate` | `pid`, `pollutant`, optional `pathway` | `huc_id`, `pollutant`, optional `pathway` | `pollutant`, optional `pathway` |
| Surface/subsurface concentrations | `pid`, `pollutant` | `huc_id`, `pollutant` | `pollutant` |
| Curve number/infiltration fraction | `land_cover`, `hsg`, optional `pid` | `huc_id`, `land_cover`, `hsg` | `land_cover`, `hsg` |
| Delivery ratios | `pid`, `oid` | `huc_id`, `oid` | `oid` |

For HUC/domain RUSLE factors and concentrations, an optional `land_cover` key selects rows matching each parcel's effective classification. HUC/domain delivery rows with NULL `oid` apply to the assigned parcels' connected outlets. Parcel delivery defaults still require both `pid` and `oid` to be NULL. Lookup rows without a parcel `pid` act as parcel defaults below HUC and domain lookup rows; an optional exact `pid` supplies a local override.

Examples:

```text
# hucs.gpkg:input_pollutant_load_rate
huc_id   | pollutant | mean | sd  | units
05090202 | TN        | 8.0  | 1.5 | kg/ha/year

# domain.gpkg:input_pollutant_load_rate
pollutant | value | units
TN        | 6.0   | kg/ha/year

# domain.gpkg:input_rain_days
value | units
100   | days/year
```

Inherited distributions share one draw per source row per scenario, with separate groups for different variables/natural keys. An explicit `sample_group` can request broader sharing for the same variable. Parcel-default distributions remain independent unless explicitly grouped. Classifications and selection/delivery weights remain fixed-only.

Missing rows fall through to the next scope; malformed rows fail even if overridden. Entire rows override, so fixed values and distribution statistics are never blended. Required coverage is validated after inheritance; a required table need not physically exist in the parcel package if HUC/domain inputs supply it. Unknown `input_*` tables are rejected. Do not mix aggregate and pathway-specific statistical load-rate rows across scopes.

### Parcel-to-HUC assignment

The optional `parcel_huc` table in the parcel GeoPackage stores:

```text
pid | huc_id   | area_fraction
1   | 05090202 | 0.95
```

If supplied, it must assign every modeled parcel exactly once and reference known parcel/HUC IDs. If absent, the loader computes assignments from the modeled (domain-clipped) parcels without changing the input files. The greatest positive area overlap wins; equal overlaps are broken by ascending HUC ID. Values are not blended across boundaries. A parcel intersecting no HUC is an error.

`area_fraction` is optional for stored assignments, must be in [0, 1], and records the fraction of parcel area in its assigned HUC. Values below 0.75 are logged to `log.txt` without a console warning. Regenerate stored assignments after changing parcel or HUC geometry.

To persist assignments using local HUC polygons at any supported level:

```text
python utils/create_parcel_huc.py parcels.gpkg hucs.gpkg
```

The utility supports `--huc-layer`, `--huc-field`, and `--parcel-layer`; it updates only the registered `parcel_huc` table. It uses the source parcel geometry, whereas automatic runtime assignment uses the clipped modeled geometry.

### Existing HUC12 packages and migration

Existing spatial `huc12` layers, `huc12` input keys, and `parcel_huc12` relationships remain readable. The `plet_forcing` YAML key remains a deprecated alias; do not supply it together with `huc_parameters`. Prefer `parcel_huc` if both relationship tables exist. East Fork inputs now live in `inputs/hucs`; their legacy internal table names and data are unchanged.

The existing HUC12 download/workbook utilities remain HUC12-specific. See [PLET/RUSLE preparation](plet_rusle_mode.md#build-or-refresh-the-huc12-forcing-input) for their options. Use the generic local assignment utility for other levels. Do not run the HUC12-specific refresh utilities against generic HUC packages.

### PLET parcel variables

Each of these tables is keyed by `pid`:

- `input_avg_rain_in` (PLET `AVG_RAIN`, inches/event; optional direct event-rainfall forcing)
- `input_annual_precip_in` (legacy/derived forcing)
- `input_rain_days`
- `input_rain_correction_fraction` (required only when `input_avg_rain_in` is not supplied)
- `input_runoff_day_fraction`
- `input_land_cover`
- `input_hsg`
- `input_ia_ratio`

`input_land_cover` and `input_hsg` are categorical and therefore require fixed `value` entries; distributions are not allowed.

PLET precipitation forcing may be supplied in either of two forms:

1. **Direct PLET form:** `input_avg_rain_in` + `input_rain_days` + `input_runoff_day_fraction`. `avg_rain_in` is the PLET Input Data Server `AVG_RAIN` value and is used directly as event rainfall `P`.
2. **Derived form:** `input_annual_precip_in` + `input_rain_correction_fraction` + `input_rain_days` + `input_runoff_day_fraction`. The model derives `P = annual_precip_in * rain_correction_fraction / (rain_days * runoff_day_fraction)`.

If `input_avg_rain_in` is present for a parcel, it is authoritative. Annual runoff is still multiplied by the corrected number of runoff-producing rain days, `rain_days * runoff_day_fraction`. For subsurface infiltration, corrected annual precipitation is reconstructed as `avg_rain_in * rain_days * runoff_day_fraction`, which is algebraically equivalent to `annual_precip_in * rain_correction_fraction` when `AVG_RAIN` comes from PLET Equation 3.


### Curve number and infiltration fraction

PLET hydrology assumptions are user inputs stored in the same parcel GeoPackage:

- `input_curve_number`
- `input_infiltration_fraction`

These two tables are keyed by:

```text
land_cover | hsg
```

and then use the standard numeric/distribution columns. Every land-cover × HSG pair actually used by modeled parcels must have both a curve-number definition and an infiltration-fraction definition. Reusable tables may contain additional valid pairings. Either variable may be fixed or stochastic.

There is no separate `hydrology_lookup` file or source-code fallback.

### RUSLE and sediment variables

Each table is keyed by `pid`:

- `input_rusle_r`
- `input_rusle_k`
- `input_rusle_ls`
- `input_rusle_c`
- `input_rusle_p`
- `input_sediment_delivery_ratio`
- `input_sediment_n_pct`
- `input_sediment_p_pct`
- `input_enrichment_ratio`

The loader assembles these tables into the existing runtime RUSLE parameter representation before scenario execution.

### Statistical load rate

`input_pollutant_load_rate` is required in statistical mode.

Keys:

- `pid`
- `pollutant`
- optional `pathway`

The table uses the common numeric/distribution schema. `pid IS NULL` defaults and parcel-specific integer-PID overrides are supported.

### PLET pollutant concentrations

PLET/RUSLE uses two separate input variables:

- `input_surface_concentration`
- `input_subsurface_concentration`

Both are keyed by:

```text
pid | pollutant
```

and use the common numeric/distribution schema. The pathway is implied by the table name rather than stored in a `pathway` column.

### Delivery-ratio variables

The parcel-to-outlet relationship remains in `parcel_outlets`. Each optional delivery variable is stored separately:

- `input_sdr_f_to_s`
- `input_sdr_s_to_o`
- `input_ndr_f_to_s`
- `input_ndr_s_to_o`

Keys:

```text
pid | oid
```

These are deterministic fractions in `[0, 1]`. An exact parcel/outlet row overrides an optional global row where both `pid` and `oid` are SQL `NULL`. Partial defaults (only one key NULL) are invalid. If a table is absent, the neutral value `1.0` is used.

## `outlets.gpkg`

Configured with:

```yaml
outlets: ../outlets/outlets.gpkg
```

`outlets` is the required spatial layer with unique `oid` and point geometry.

`outlet_stats` is an optional attribute table keyed by `oid × pollutant` with optional nonnegative `target` and `mean` columns.

## Other CSV inputs


`bmp_efficiency` defines BMP efficiency values/distributions by CPS, pollutant, and pathway where applicable.

`bmp_cost` is optional and defines BMP cost inputs. Each row represents one
additive cost component for a CPS code. Multiple rows may therefore share the
same `cps`; their independently sampled/scaled component costs are summed for
each individual BMP placement. Use `cost_component` to give each component a
unique descriptive name. Supported units include `USD/ha`, `USD/m`, and
`USD/project`, so components with different scaling can be combined for one
BMP. Legacy files without `cost_component` remain valid and are interpreted as
a single component named `total`.

The optional `citations` and `notes` columns are metadata only and do not
affect sampling. For example:

```csv
cps,cps_name,cost_component,unit,value,mean,sd,min,p05,p50,p95,max,citations,notes
340,Cover Crop,seed,USD/ha,,,,40,45,55,70,80,https://example.org/source,Example only
340,Cover Crop,establishment,USD/ha,,,,20,30,50,80,100,https://example.org/source,Example only
```
